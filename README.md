# My .nvim configurations

I just started to switch from vim to [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) â€“ mainly to use the [VSCode-Neovim-Plugin](https://github.com/asvetliakov/vscode-neovim).

This repo is my attempt on configuring the whole thing to my likings. It is heavily inspired by the really great repo / configs of [ChristzianChiarulli/LunarVim](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/LunarVim).

The configurations are within `~/.config/nvim`
